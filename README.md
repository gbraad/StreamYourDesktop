# St(r)eam your Desktop

[!["Stream your desktop"](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gbraad/stream-desktop/master/icons/icon_64.png)](http://github.com/gbraad/stream-desktop)

A small helper application that shows maximized and triggers the Start Menu to show. This can help with streaming your remote desktop on Windows using In-Home Streaming. I created this because I wasn't happy with the 'notepad'-workaround and having to press F1, which now opens the Edge browser.


Download one of the [releases](https://github.com/gbraad/stream-desktop/releases/), save it somewhere on your host you want to see the desktop of, add as a Non-Steam game, and start streaming. Would appreciate some feedback, especially if it works for you.
